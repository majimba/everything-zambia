### **Font Pairings (Typography)**

Our typography must balance the gravitas of a national archive (**The Sage**) with the clarity of a modern media platform (**The Explorer**). All suggested fonts are available for free on Google Fonts.

#### **1. For Headings: Authoritative & Elegant Serif**

This font carries the weight of history and the authority of our research. It should be used for all primary headlines and titles.

* **Primary Choice: Playfair Display**
    * **Why:** It is elegant, classic, and has a high contrast that gives it a sophisticated, "magazine" feel. It speaks to heritage and quality.
* **Alternative: Lora**
    * **Why:** A well-balanced, highly readable serif that is excellent for both screen and print. It feels contemporary and trustworthy.

**Example Headline (Playfair Display):**
> *The Enduring Legacy of the Lozi Kingdom*

---

#### **2. For Body Text: Clean & Accessible Sans-Serif**

This font is the workhorse of the brand. It must be exceptionally readable on all devices, ensuring our stories are accessible to everyone.

* **Primary Choice: Lato**
    * **Why:** It's a friendly yet professional sans-serif that was designed to feel warm and stable. It's exceptionally clear at small sizes, making it perfect for long articles on mobile phones.
* **Alternative: Montserrat**
    * **Why:** It has a clean, geometric structure that feels modern and urban, perfect for aligning with our forward-looking content.

**Example Body Text (Lato):**
> *According to the Eighth National Development Plan, the government's primary focus is on socio-economic transformation. This strategy connects directly to the lived reality of our citizens...*

---

### **Putting It All Together: Recommended Pairing**

For a cohesive and powerful identity, this pairing is recommended:

* **Headings:** **Playfair Display** (Bold)
* **Subheadings:** **Montserrat** (Bold or Semibold)
* **Body Text:** **Lato** (Regular)

This combination provides a perfect balance: the classic elegance of Playfair Display for historical weight, the modern clarity of Montserrat for navigation, and the superb readability of Lato for immersive storytelling.
