## 🌟 **The National Project**

Everything Zambia is **A NATIONAL PROJECT** to establish the definitive cultural voice of Zambia through authentic storytelling that bridges tradition, modernity, and global curiosity.

This is not just research - this is a **MASTER'S MEDIA PROJECT** and **CULTURAL MOVEMENT** that captures, celebrates, and amplifies Zambia's cultural heartbeat while fostering critical conversations about governance, digital life, and modern Zambian identity.

**We are building the definitive cultural platform - from ancient kingdoms to modern democracy, from constitutional rights to youth-focused social documentaries, from traditional ceremonies to digital innovation.**

**WHAT:** Premium content including digital magazine, video series, podcasts, hard-hitting social documentaries, social media, events, and curated merchandise.
