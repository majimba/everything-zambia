**Simulate**: How each persona evaluates cultural authenticity and relevance

**AI Questions to Explore**:
- What makes content feel authentically Zambian to them?
- How do they distinguish between authentic and inauthentic representation?
- What cultural elements are most important to preserve?
- How do they want to see traditional and modern elements balanced?

### **Scenario 3: Platform and Format Preferences**
**Simulate**: How each persona prefers to consume and interact with content

**AI Questions to Explore**:
- What formats work best for their lifestyle and access?
- How do they prefer to engage with community and culture?
