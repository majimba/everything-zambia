**Template**:
```
We have observed that [target audience] struggle with [specific problem] when [context/situation]. This matters because [impact on Zambian society/culture]. A successful solution would [desired outcome] while [cultural authenticity requirements].
```

#### **Multi-Perspective Problem Definition**
**AI Task**: Develop problem statements from different stakeholder perspectives.

**Perspectives**:

- **National**: Zambian identity and global representation needs
- **Global**: International understanding and engagement needs

### **Success Metrics Development**

#### **Cultural Impact Metrics**
**AI Task**: Define metrics that measure cultural authenticity and impact.

**Potential Metrics**:
- **Authenticity Rating**: Community validation of cultural accuracy
- **Cultural Engagement**: Participation in cultural activities and sharing
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Traditional knowledge documentation and sharing
- **Identity Strengthening**: User-reported cultural identity connection

#### **User Engagement Metrics**
**AI Task**: Define metrics that measure user value and satisfaction.

**Potential Metrics**:
- **User Satisfaction**: Overall experience rating
- **Engagement Depth**: Time spent and content consumption
- **Return Usage**: Frequency of platform visits
- **Content Sharing**: User-generated content and sharing behavior

#### **Business Sustainability Metrics**
**AI Task**: Define metrics that measure platform viability and growth.

**Potential Metrics**:
- **User Growth**: Platform adoption and expansion
- **Content Quality**: Educational and cultural value assessment
- **Partnership Development**: Academic and business collaboration
- **Global Reach**: International recognition and engagement

## üìä **AI Assumption Testing**

### **Cultural Authenticity Assumptions**

#### **Assumption 1: Digital-First Approach**
**AI Test**: "Do all Zambian users prefer digital-first cultural experiences?"
**Simulation**: Test with traditional guardians and rural users
**Validation**: Identify balance between digital and traditional approaches

#### **Assumption 2: English Dominance**
**AI Test**: "Is English the primary language for cultural content consumption?"
**Simulation**: Test with local language preferences and accessibility
**Validation**: Define multilingual approach and language priorities

#### **Assumption 3: Global Appeal**
**AI Test**: "Should Everything Zambia prioritize global appeal over local authenticity?"
**Simulation**: Test with different user groups and cultural priorities
**Validation**: Establish balance between local authenticity and global reach

### **Platform Strategy Assumptions**

#### **Assumption 4: Mobile-First Design**
**AI Test**: "Is mobile-first the optimal approach for all users?"
**Simulation**: Test with different device access and usage patterns
**Validation**: Define responsive design strategy for various access levels

#### **Assumption 5: Community-Driven Content**
**AI Test**: "Should Everything Zambia be primarily user-generated content?"
**Simulation**: Test with content quality, curation, and expertise needs
**Validation**: Establish balance between community and curated content

## üéØ **AI Solution Framework Development**

### **Cultural Value Proposition**

#### **Core Value Propositions**
**AI Task**: Develop clear value propositions for different user segments.

**For Zambian Citizens**:
- "Connect with your authentic Zambian identity through stories, traditions, and community"
- "Preserve and share your cultural heritage with future generations"
- "Bridge traditional wisdom with modern life"

**For Students & Researchers**:
- "Access comprehensive, authentic Zambian cultural and historical resources"
- "Contribute to academic understanding of Zambian identity and culture"
- "Support research with primary sources and community insights"

**For Business & Investors**:
- "Understand Zambian cultural context for better business decisions"
- "Access market intelligence and cultural insights"
- "Connect with Zambian community and values"

**For International Audience**:
- "Discover authentic Zambian culture and identity"
- "Understand Zambian values and cultural context"
- "Engage with Zambian community and stories"

### **Design Principles**

#### **AI-Validated Design Principles**
**AI Task**: Develop and validate design principles through simulation testing.

**Potential Principles**:
1. **Cultural Authenticity First**: Every decision prioritizes cultural accuracy and respect
2. **Accessibility and Inclusion**: Platform accessible to all Zambians regardless of digital access
3. **Community-Driven**: Zambian community shapes content and direction
