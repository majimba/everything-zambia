# üóìÔ∏è 8-Week Design Thinking Execution Plan (Everything Zambia)

Purpose: Fast, evidence-based progress from discovery to validated prototypes, adapted to Zambia‚Äôs cultural and access realities.

Assumptions
- Mixed-methods research; AI simulation used to sharpen instruments before fieldwork
- Low-data, multilingual, offline-inclusive approach
- Weekly showcase + decisions; no week slips without trade-off note

Roles (can overlap in small team)
- Lead (facilitator/PM), Researcher, Community Liaison, Content Lead, UX/Prototype, Tech Lead, Cultural Advisors (elders/experts)

---

## Week 1 ‚Äî Mobilize & Empathize (Kickoff)
Focus
- Align on mission, guardrails, and measures. Prepare research instruments.
Outputs
- Finalized research plan and consent forms
- Interview guide + short survey (see `design_thinking/templates.md`)
- Persona hypotheses (3‚Äì5) and sampling frame
- Logistics plan for urban/rural outreach; language needs
Showcase decision
- Greenlight instruments and sampling; identify first 10 interviewees

## Week 2 ‚Äî Field Empathy (Urban pass 1)
Focus
- 10‚Äì15 interviews + 100+ micro-surveys in urban contexts; parallel AI sims to refine probes
Outputs
- Notes, recordings, key quotes; empathy maps (draft)
- Updated personas; early journey map sketches
- Preliminary pain points and cultural sensitivities log
Showcase decision
- Top 5 validated needs; gaps for rural pass

## Week 3 ‚Äî Field Empathy (Rural pass)
Focus
- 10‚Äì15 interviews + 100+ micro-surveys in rural contexts; WhatsApp-first tactics
Outputs
- Rural empathy maps; language insights; data-access constraints
- Authenticity trust signals inventory (who/what users trust)
- Risks register (cultural + access) started
Showcase decision
- Consolidated personas (4‚Äì6) and priority needs

## Week 4 ‚Äî Define & Frame
Focus
- Synthesis, problem statements, opportunity canvas, design principles
Outputs
- 3‚Äì5 problem statements + success metrics (cultural/user/business)
- Assumptions to test; measurement plan
- Design principles and authenticity guardrails
Showcase decision
- Select 2‚Äì3 problem statements for ideation

## Week 5 ‚Äî Ideate & Select
Focus
- Diverge widely; converge with matrix and community input
Outputs
- 50+ ideas captured; ranked matrix; top 6 concepts
- Concept one-pagers (who, value, authenticity, risks)
- Partner opportunities list (media, schools, cultural bodies)
Showcase decision
- Choose top 3 concepts to prototype (with rationale)

## Week 6 ‚Äî Prototype (Low/Medium Fidelity)
Focus
- Build quick artifacts; plan tests mindful of data limits
Outputs
- Low/med prototypes (content samples, flows, UI mocks)
- Test scripts + participant list (n‚â•10 per concept)
- Authenticity approval process with cultural advisors
Showcase decision
- Readiness to run tests; any scope cuts to stay on time

## Week 7 ‚Äî Test & Iterate
Focus
- Run task-based tests; capture cultural validation; iterate once
Outputs
- Results summary per concept (usability, authenticity, access)
- P0/P1 change list; revised prototypes
- Go/No-Go recommendation per concept
Showcase decision
- Pick 1‚Äì2 concepts for high-fidelity or pilot

## Week 8 ‚Äî Validate & Plan Next Phase
Focus
- Final validation; pilot plan; governance and funding path
Outputs
- Final report: findings, decisions, artifacts links
- Pilot scope (features, locales, languages), metrics dashboard
- Cultural approval records; ethics and governance addendum
- Budget + partners + 90-day roadmap
Showcase decision
- Approve pilot kickoff; lock success metrics and governance

Milestone Checklist
- Empathy: ‚â•25 interviews, ‚â•200 surveys spanning urban/rural
- Define: 3‚Äì5 problem statements with metrics and assumptions
- Ideate: 50+ ideas, top 3 selected with matrix evidence
- Prototype: 3 prototypes, tests with ‚â•10 users each
- Test: Cultural approval recorded; access constraints addressed
- Next: Pilot plan with partners and budget

Dashboards & Artifacts
- Store in repo under `design_thinking/` by phase
- Link evidence into `knowledge_base/` where relevant
- Use `templates.md` for consistency; update as you learn
